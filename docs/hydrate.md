# `hydrate` Addon

Re-hydrates CSS styles generated on the server. On the server add `nano-css` id to your stylesheet.

```js
html += `<style id="nano-css">${nano.raw}</style>`;
```

That's it! `hydrate` addon will find this stylesheet in the browser and will not emit CSS
rules that were already generated by the server.


## Configuration

You can set a custom id for you style sheet.

```js
import {addon as addonHydrate} from 'nano-css/addon/hydrate';

addonHydrate(nano, 'custom-id');
```


## Installation

Simply install `hydrate` addon.
