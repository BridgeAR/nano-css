# `hydrate` Addon

Re-hydrates CSS styles generated on the server. On the server add `nano-css` id to your stylesheet.

```js
html += `<style id="nano-css">${nano.raw}</style>`;
```

That's it! `hydrate` addon will find this stylesheet in the browser and will not emit CSS
rules that were already generated by the server.


## Installation

Simply install `hydrate` addon.
